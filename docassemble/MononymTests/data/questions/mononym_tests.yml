    Names
subquestion: |
  Historically, ILAO's Easy Forms have asked for users' full names by asking for their first, middle, and last names.

  The following page is our standard way to ask for a user's name.
---
id: user 0 name
sets:
    - users[0].name.first
    - users[0].name.last
    - users[0].name.middle
    - users[0].name.suffix
question:  |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - code: |
      users[0].name_fields()

question: |
    Mononyms
subquestion: |
    The problem with the previous page is that it required the user to enter both a first and last name. Unfortunately, we have received feedback that this is a problem for people who do not have both a first and last name. 

    We have drafted three possible new standards for name questions. The following pages show these options
---
sets:
  - users[1].name.first
id: user 1 name
question: |
  What is your name?
fields:
  - Full name: users[1].name.first
    show if: mononym_check
  - First: users[1].name.first
    show if: 
      variable: mononym_check
      is: False
  - Middle: users[1].name.middle
    required: False
    show if: 
      variable: mononym_check
      is: False
  - Last: users[1].name.last
    show if: 
      variable: mononym_check
      is: False
  - Suffix: users[1].name.suffix
    show if: 
      variable: mononym_check
      is: False
    code: |
      name_suffix()
    required: False
  - I do not have both a first name and a last name.: mononym_check

template: name_order_help
subject: |
  **About name order**
content: |  
  Forms in Illinois expect that you will list your given name, also known as a personal name, first. They expect that you will list your surname, also known as a family name, last.

sets:
  - users[3].name.first
id: user 3 name
question: |
  What is your name?
subquestion: |
    ${collapse_template(mononym_help)}

    required: False
  - Last: users[3].name.last
    required: False
  - Suffix: users[3].name.suffix
    help: |
      Some names have a suffix after the last name, such as "Sr." or "Jr." If your name does not have a suffix, you can leave this blank.
    code: |
      name_suffix()
    required: False

template: mononym_help
subject: |
  **What to do if you don't have a first and last name**
content: |  
  If you have one name, you can enter it in the field labeled **First** and leave the other fields blank.

  Going forward
subquestion: |
  Once we have settled on a standard, we plan to use it in most of our Easy Forms. 
  
  Unfortunately, some efiling platforms require users to input both first and last names. As a result, we may need to retain the old version of the name question in some Easy Forms to prevent incongruence between the completed forms and the user name input into e-filing platforms.
